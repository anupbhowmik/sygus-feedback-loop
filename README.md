# SyGus Feedback Loop LLM

This repository contains code for a feedback loop system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGus) problems. The system iteratively refines its solutions based on feedback from the LLM, aiming to improve the quality and correctness of the synthesized programs.
